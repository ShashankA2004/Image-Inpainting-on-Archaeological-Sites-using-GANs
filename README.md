## Image Inpainting on Archeological Dataset using Context Encoder GAN
This repository contains the implementation and evaluation of a novel approach for enhancing the quality of picture inpainting in archaeological datasets. The proposed method uses context encoder GAN by incorporating the MS-SSIM loss function, which effectively denoises the output. The goal is to reconstruct damaged or missing portions of images commonly found in archaeological photographs due to the passage of time or excavationÂ procedures.

## Introduction
Image inpainting is a widely used technique in various domains, including image editing, object removal, and image restoration. In the context of archaeological data, this technique becomes valuable for restoring and analyzing historical images. This paper presents a novel approach that significantly improves the quality of picture inpainting in archaeological datasets. intro_images
